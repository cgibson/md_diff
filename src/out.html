<h1>Prologue</h1>

<p>I stare at the receding PDA and curse. I grip the railing more firmly, ensure my footing is right and rock back and forth before pushing off, the railing of the maintenance tube moving past as my body is propelled by inertia alone. My trajectory is forward and a little up, so once I reach the center of the three foot wide tube I bend my body and twist, a maneuver you get used to when reorienting yourself in zero gravity. My body is now facing the 'ceiling' of the tube (yeah, we still use terms like 'floor' and 'ceiling'. Evolution has ingrained a deep-seated need to categorize our spatial surroundings. Arguing semantics is fun, but honestly not as applicable as you'd think.)</p>

<p>I stretch out and give enough of a push to arrest my movement toward either side of the tube, letting myself float effortlessly down the tube with nothing to stop me but wind resistance. I could glide fifty to a hundred yards on a good kick, which can be useful when you spent a good deal of your time running systems checks and looking for faulty radio telescopes, like I'm doing today.</p>

<p>I reach my hand out, the PDA winking at me flirtatiously as it continues its tumble. Its corner pings off of one of the hand holds, causing its path to grow more erratic. I drift steadily closer.</p>

<p>My headset clicks on and begins playing the second verse of The Blue Danube, its melancholic violins and strings turning what was supposed to be a quick snatch and grab into a mockery. Ba da da da dummm... da dumm... da dumm...</p>

<p>"Very funny." I say through gritted teeth, too focused on the PDA to give a proper retort. A female voice responds, the deadpan monotone betraying its synthetic origin.</p>

<p>"I was torn between this and the 2001 Space Odyssey opening theme. However, I estimated you would reach the PDA before the drums, ruining the effect." The panel hits my fingertip, propelling it once more just beyond my reach. The voice continues, "It appears my estimation was incorrect."</p>

<p>"Very funny." I growl, catching a hand hold and propelling myself once more. I catch up to the fleeing hardware just as it enters one of the main junctions, a large spherical room with maintenance tubes shooting off in six different directions. I shoot my hand out, snapping the PDA from the air and curl into a ball forcing my body to tumble. Halfway through my flip I extend my body once more, legs bent just in time for them to gain a hold on the opposite wall. I crouch as my legs absorb my momentum. The last climatic notes of the song clip echo in my head.</p>

<p>"IVI... The rest of the active crew told me adding sarcasm to your programming was a mistake. I should have listened to them," I quip, looking down at my tablet's screen. To my relief, my next stop is a straight shot from where I am now. I sigh, noting the time. "Six down... two to go."</p>

<p>"You are making excellent time, Tim," the disembodied voice responds in my headset, "zero gravity ballet notwithstanding."</p>

<p>The tablet clicks onto a mag lock on my belt and I crawl into tube code-named Blue-32. The ship is immense and contains hundreds of miles of maintenance ducts, tubes and hallways, but was also designed by engineers. Good engineers... and good engineers tend to be lazy for all the right reasons. The ship is laid out like a skyscraper, each corridor color denoting the axis that hallway runs along and each number denoting what floor it is on. This allows folks like me to move around without needing to constantly look at my current location on a PDA or helmet HUD. You just take a mag-lift to whatever section is closest to your destination and tube the rest of the way. I can get anywhere on the colony ship <em>Domina Novum</em> in less than 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Which is good, especially for a day like today when I seem to be jumping from one problem to the next. It takes me less than five minutes to get to the next console, attaching my PDA and looking through the raw logs.</p>

<p>IVI speaks up again, "You already ran checks on these sensor banks from your PC. Why do you need to visit them in person?"</p>

<p>I hook one of my legs into one of the rails to keep myself oriented while I click through menus. "Because..." I say, the stylus sticking out one side of my mouth gripped by my molars, "the bug report says that the radio telescope is picking up a signal from our own ship, and I confirmed that, but none of the diagnostics reported any signal interference. So, obviously, they can't be trusted."</p>

<p>"I did those checks myself, Tim."</p>

<p>"Oh don't pretend I hurt your feelings, IVI." I say, chewing on the stylus as I click through menus, "Obviously we've got a faulty relay, I just need to find it."</p>

<p>"Isn't it possible that the diagnostic is correct, and that is no signal interference?" IVI says.</p>

<p>"If that were the case," I say, "that would mean that we're picking up a signal from another ship <strong>5000</strong> lighyears from Earth. We are thousands of lightyears from any other colony ship."</p>

<p>I pause for a moment. "There's no one else out here, IVI."</p>

<p>Two fruitless hours later, I reach the gravity rail junction where a grav lift is waiting for me. I strap in and the pod accelerates at 1.4 gravity by way of sequential magnetic pulses, much like a railgun. An analogy I had always enjoyed, but had never been particularly popular with some of the crew. I gaze somewhat listlessly out the large windows along one side giving me glimpses of a large hollow cylinder and thousands of green lights winking as I pass. None of the relays showed any signs of cross signal interference. It doesn't make any sense. Where is that signal coming from?</p>

<p>The winking lights of the hundreds of thousands of "sleeper" berths finally draw my attention, each a honeycomb partition with six stasis pods inside. Imagining the number of lives on this ship always gives me the chills. All looking for a home. Like me.</p>

<p>Eventually I find myself in the main lounge, feet planted firmly on the ground with the assistance of artificial gravity, or as some of us like to call it, magic. A good portion of the active crew is here, about twenty people. We're about thirty minutes into our four hour combined down time, when the day and night shift have some time to intermix. I go to the bar to order a beer.</p>

<p>"Hey, you're late," brown skinned woman with hair tied back into a short, black ponytail says as she swoops in next me. Sandra, the ranking medical officer in our rotation.</p>

<p>"Late for what?"</p>

<p>"We had a game scheduled five minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, right," I say, remembering the game of <span style='background-color: #d88'>paintball</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Halo</span> I had agreed to. "Listen, I'm not really feeling up to it tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh come on," Sandra says. "It'll help take your mind of off..." She gestures at me. "Well, whatever it is that's <span style='background-color: #d88'>bugging.</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>bugging you.</span> Besides, Amelia is going to be there."</p>

<p>"Wait, what?" I say in sudden anxiety. "Why is Amelia going to be there?"</p>

<p>"Because I invited her, silly," she says. "Come one," she continues, grabbing my arm. "You'll be fine."</p>

<p>"I'm really not feeling my best--"</p>

<p>"And I'm really not taking no for answer. You've had two weeks to get to know this <span style='background-color: #d88'>girl,</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>girl;</span> now you're getting my assistance. Come on, everyone else is already getting plugged in."</p>

<p>A few minutes later I <span style='background-color: #d88'>set</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>step</span> up into the VR pod, which is sphere about four meters in diameter sitting up against a wall along with a dozen others. <span style='background-color: #d88'>the</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>The</span> spherical door slides shut behind me. I turn around and I place my feet into the holsters which quickly bind themselves around my feet and ankles. The rest of the ground recedes away revealing the pneumatic stilts my feet are attached to. I lift up my right foot and the stilt comes up with me effortlessly. I step over to the side and stilt tracks with my movement stopping at the previous ground level, giving me the feel of solid ground. I put on the vest hanging behind me which is attached to pneumatic arm along the spine and then reach my hands up into the gloves attached to similar pneumatic arms floating in front of me. The gloves shrink to fit my hand. I move around and the gloves, stilts, and vest track with me, extending, retracting, and swiveling around the edge of the sphere as needed, the stilts providing resistance when my feet hit the "ground". I crouch down and try to place my hands through the ground level. The gloves stop and provide resistance. Then I reach up and pull down the headset dangling over my head. The headset covers my eyes then tightens and adjusts itself to fit my head comfortably.</p>

<p>"Welcome back, Tim," a synthesized voice says in my ear.</p>

<p>"Hi, IVI."</p>

<p>An array of floating screens appear before me. I look down in time to watch my body and arms materialize as well, looking almost exactly like me real body. I'm wearing Star Trek uniform. The screens in front of me show me a montage of landscapes and locations, another of various sports and games, the last of people moving about in various time era costumes.</p>

<p>"Would you like to join Sandra's Halo game?" IVI says.</p>

<p>"Not really, but go ahead and put <span style='background-color: #d88'>me."</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>me in."</span></p>

<p>The screens fade away as does the rest of my view. A moment later I find myself in the middle of a grassy field with huge boulders scattered about and mountains stretching high into the sky in the distance. My Star Fleet uniform has changed into full body armor.</p>

<p>"Hey, hey, look who finally made it," says an individual next to me in blue armor.</p>

<p>"Hi Dex," I say nodding to my night shift <span style='background-color: #d88'>counterpart.</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>counterpart, his nearly black skin and wide nose visible behind a clear, virtual faceplate.</span></p>

<p>"You fixed the issue with the signal interference, right?" Dex says.</p>

<p>"Nope," I say. "I spent two hours trying to find the thing and the only thing I found up there was a headache."</p>

<p>"Great," Dex says. "That means I get to go find a headache too."</p>

<p>"Tim," Sandra says, also in blue armor,<span style='background-color: #d88'>his face visible behind the clear faceplate,</span> "I think you've met Amelia before, right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Amelia says. "I saw you at the movie night last week I think."</p>

<p>I get lost in those perfect features glowing behind her virtual face mask before my brain finally comes up with a response. "Hi."</p>

<p>"Okay, well," Sandra says. "We're playing capture flag and we should be starting soon."</p>

<p>"Thirty seconds to mission start," IVI's voice says, seeming to come from everywhere.</p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Okay, here's how this is going to work," Dex says. "Tim, Amelia, and I are going to take the warthog over to the other base and capture their flag. Sandra and Hans," he says guesting to our fifth blue and larger comrade, "you two will take the standard positions and defend our flag. Sound good."</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Ja," Hans says.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Hai," Amelia says.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Si," Sandra replies.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>I just nod.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Okay," Dex says, "well, glad we got the international team together. Just remember that some of us only speak English and very small amounts of Klingon."</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>IVI's voice returns. "Three, two, one, begin."</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Let'd go!" Dex shouts.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Dex takes off at an impossible fast pace, and then jumps twenty feet in the air over one of the boulders. I race after him, at the same speed and make the same jump, with Amelia just a meter in front of me. As I soar through the air, I can just barely feel myself being suspended mid air by the vest.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>The warthog, a heavily reinforced open air jeep with a massive turret on the back, await us. Dex jumps over the vehicle and then pulls himself into the driver's seat. Amelia deftly jumps from four meters away and lands directly behind the turret. I slide into the shot gun position and pull my battle rifle from my back. The rifle feels heavy and solid, courtesy of the mechanical gloves I'm wearing, giving just enough resistance to mimic a real world rifle, but lighter since in this game, I'm supposed to be a superhuman Spartan from the twenty-fifth century. Oddly enough, that was four hundreds years in the future when this game was made, but is now actually fairly close to the present.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Dex quickly accelerates the warthog to nearly 120 kilometers and hour as we rumble and sometimes fly across the terrain.</span>
<span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Bad guys at one o'clock," I call out as I raise my battle rifle.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"I see them," Amelia says. She swivels the turret to track the two red figures shooting across the terrain in an ATV. The turret thunders overhead, not nearly as loud as the real thing would be, but loud enough for me to feel it vibrate through my body.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>I fire my battle rifle, the weapon kicking back in my hand, but still aiming true.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>A few of my shots light up the driver's personal shield. Then Amelia's turret fire blows up the ground just in front of the ATV causing it leap and roll through the air. It lands again on the wheels and continues forward, now at our four o'clock. The gunner riding of the back of the ATV gets a few shots in. The bullets bounce loudly off of the vehicle's frame and one hits me the shoulder, causing me to jerk. It doesn't really hurt, but it's just sudden. The VR chamber hits me with a very focused blast of hot air in my shoulder to simulate getting hit.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>I lean back out of my side of the vehicle just in time to see Amelia's turret fire blaze right through the ATV's armor and exploding the engine block. The two red Spartans go flying through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Wooo!" Amelia hollers.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Yeah!" I shout, pumping my fist into the air.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>As we rumble across the map, a large metal structure comes into view.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Eyes up front," I say. "I see enemies on the base."</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Amelia starts firing at red soldier standing on the edge of a platform in the middle of the structure weilding a rocket launcher.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>I notice a red dot dancing around the hood of the warthog.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>"Break!" I scream.</span></p>

<p><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Dex hits the break and I lurch forward. My raised hand catches one of the overhead struts stoping me from flying forward out of the vehicle as red laser destroys the ground in front of us.</span></p>

<p>The door whisks to the side on silent rails and I step into the midst of several discussions going on at once. Nearly twenty crew members are in the room, some sitting in the chairs provided, some huddled in groups along the perimeter. I spot a few other techies who wave in my direction, several engineers and maintenance workers discussing their latest projects. The only two that seem apart from the rest stand at the front of the room.</p>

<p>Armaan, the mission commander, stands stoically behind the small podium, her back straight, eyes alert and dark hair pulled into a severe bun. I had developed the theory that the commander spends most of her day ironing her uniform. I have never seen her out of her ship officer blues unless we are doing EVA training or other exercises that require our multi-function ship suits.</p>

<p>Beside her stands Lieutenant Miles. Unlike Armaan who has perfect, unblemished olive skin, Miles is the kind of square jawed, heavy browed, broad shouldered military muscle you would expect to see in a war holo-drama. I'm not saying he's messy compared to the commander, he's always clean shaven, but he still manages to give an aura, like he's one step away from swearing like a sailor with only the commander to keep him in check. Not that it did much to keep him from hurling insults my way.</p>

<p>Speaking of... Miles is the second person in the room to notice my entrance, and the grin he gives me doesn't reach his cold eyes. "Little Timmy get lost again?" he asks, making only a cursory glance to ensure Armaan is otherwise occupied. I ignore him and move to find a seat.</p>

<p>I hadn't taken five steps before the door opens behind me and a gruff voice calls out in the crisp and clear annunciation that only non-english speakers seem to own.</p>

<p>"About bloody time. I got miserably lost!" Cato exclaims, nearly getting his tweed jacket stuck in the door as it closes behind him. Prentice Cato... Linguistics professor by day and <strong><em>_</em></strong> by night. "You'd really think the designers of this damned ship would have made it easier to navigate." He complains, adjusting his spectacles to look at the small PDA in his hand as if trying to make extra sure he was in the right place. He drops his coat and bag down and slumps in the seat beside me. Being the only one who had really acknowledged his presence, he had gravitated my way to unload his woes. Thankfully, he didn't have time, as a loud chirp from the speakers got the crew's attention and the men and women silently took their seats.</p>

<p>Armaan looks up at the suddenly silent room, making eye contact with several before speaking up, her lilting British accent always bringing a note of seriousness to anything she says.</p>

<p>"Thank you all for coming on such short notice," she says. "As many of you are aware, this is not a normally scheduled meeting and any current concerns and questions should be left for after the briefing." As to-the-point and succinct as the commander normally is, her tone betrayed the severity of the topic she was about to broach, further silencing any hushed whispers. Armaan again surveyed the room as she allowed the silence to lengthen.</p>

<p>"We have received IFF telemetry from one of our ships."</p>

<p>If I could have heard a pin drop a few seconds ago, I doubt I would miss a pin being dropped three decks below with how silent the room has become.</p>

<p>"This signal is weak, just a carrier wave being sent from a point seven light years distant. However, we are certain it is the same sub-luminal carrier signal used by the previous generation Arc colony ships." She makes a minute adjustment in her stance, speaking more slowly now, "...as you all are aware, our antimatter reserves are dropping dangerously low. However, this is well within nominal jump distance. This will give us a unique opportunity..."</p>

<p>This is where I lose track of what the commander is saying. This doesn't make any sense... The Arc VII ships are the first super-luminal ships in the colony fleet from Earth. We're over sixty-thousand lightyears from Sol. How could one of the pre-FTL ships have made it this far out? My mind is running a mile a minute as I try to consider the possibilities. I hear someone else speak up and I raise my hand. Armaan gives me a glance, waiting several seconds before reaching up to pinch the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p>"This isn't the Academy Tim," she says, "Go ahead, say your piece."</p>

<p>"Ma'am" I say and almost rise out of my chair but catch myself. Miles catches this and his grin grows sardonic. "It would be impossible for one of the earlier Arc ships to have made it this far out, even taking into account our subjective timelines..."</p>

<p>Armaan said nothing for several seconds, holding my gaze, which I struggle to hold. "Any possibilities come to mind?" she asks.</p>

<p>I rack my mind trying to think of possibilities. "Could be a wormhole" I mumble, eliciting a few half hearted chuckles. Though it certainly was possible, no such phenomenon had ever been recorded in nature without human intervention. I feel my face flush. Armaan nods.</p>

<p>"A good theory Alaster, it certainly seemed more likely than the ship actually being in this sector of space." she says, "but we have confirmed that there are no tell-tale signs of a man-made wormhole in that area. We would be seeing high energy output. We aligned the ship with the system and did a series of high intensity tachyon scans. We received only shadows at this distance, but we've confirmed there appears to be a ship at the Lagrange point between one of the planets and one of its moons." She looks down at her tablet and with a few swipes brings up a large screen visualization of the system with orbs tracing parabolic velocities around a bright sun. A blue dot appears among the red planets, indicating the ship. "Our astrometrics crew were able to identify many very interesting details about this planet..." she looks back up "Most notably that it is an M class planet with a nitrogen rich atmosphere."</p>

<p>Everyone begins to speak up loudly at once. I feel my heart skip a few beats. An M-class planet... could it be that this planet is capable of supporting life? Is that why the unknown colony ship had parked nearby? If it had been at full power we would have gotten a lot more than a carrier signal... so many questions.</p>

<p>"I have instructed the captain to make a jump in-system." Armaan continues, speaking loud enough to catch the attention of the rest of the crew once more. "A survey crew will be chosen to lead an initial investigation of the ship and its status." She nods to another man in military uniform, "While I am on the ship, You will answer to Chief communications officer Lieutenant Lorenz. I will be in constant communication with him throughout the mission."</p>

<p>The man gives a smart nod, several of the other military folk murmuring a "Yes Commander" which several of the civilians chime in on.</p>

<p>"Very well", the Commander says tapping her PDA to the table, the projections flicking out, "We all have a lot of work to do. Our next meeting will be tomorrow at o-nine hundred hours when we make the jump. You will all receive a list of necessary preparations on your comm tabs. Dismissed."</p>
