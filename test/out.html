<h1>Entering The Dragon</h1>

<p>"Tim? Tim."</p>

<p>I jerk awake. </p>

<p>"We're nearly there," Dr. Sandra says softly, leaning back into to her foam crash seat. The thirty-three year old, <span style='background-color: #d88'>brunnette</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>brunette</span> medic smiles my way as I get my bearings. The shuttle adjusts its vector, causing a moment of weightlessness, her harness gripping her red and white contoured space suit just as mine grips my own civilian gray.</p>

<p>Groggily, I try to focus. I distinctly remember having a dream about something, but I just can't remember what that something was. I felt like I was doing something...important. I close my eyes, trying to recall, then quickly give up as I feel our shuttle craft begin a backflip in space,  giving me a strong sense of vertigo. </p>

<p>"Domina Novum, this is Explorer 1. The ship is in sight. We're starting our deceleration burn now." Lieutenant Miles, our pilot, states, his voice brief and formal, as one expects from an honorable soldier. </p>

<p>"Alright kittens," Miles says a snarky voice, glancing back to the rest of us, "make sure you're strapped in. I don't want to have to clean you off the hull." And that's the less formal, more condescending Lieutenant Miles I've come to know and love. His square jaw, heavy brow, and powerful shoulders give him a bullish look. </p>

<p>I glance down and make sure that my harness is securely fastened. I feel a deep rumble through the floor and in my chair as the main back burners fire. A moment later, I'm slammed into my space foam seat back and feel the force of five G's do its work on my body. I close my eyes, clench my jaw, and grip my armrests, hard, trying to ignore the rising roar of the engines.. I had always imagined flying in space would be like one of those holo-vids, exhilarating and inspiring... that is, until I actually experienced it myself.</p>

<p>"Deep breaths, Tim" Doctor Sandra says, placing her hand on my shoulder. I nod, but keep my arms rigid and jaw clenched.</p>

<p>"Aww, does little Timmy need Mommy to give him a kiss?" Miles mocks in a derisive baby voice.</p>

<p>"How 'bout you focus on flying, Miles.  You crash this ship, and I'm gonna be the one stuck cleaning the mess," Joy Kekoa, our wizened senior engineer, jibes. This seems to shut Miles up.  I'm fairly certain the lieutenant finds the existence of anyone unable to bench press at least 70 kilos morally offensive and yet Joy, a stout, 57 year old civilian who doesn't even measure to his shoulder, commands his respect. I have no idea how Joy accomplished this. Whatever the reason, I've mostly learned to ignore the lieutenant's juvenile jabs.</p>

<p>"Knock it off, people," Captain Leila Armaan orders from the copilots seat in her refined British accent. "I'd like to at least make it to the ship before I need to threaten anyone with the brig.."  She's not the captain of anything -- it's a middle rank in the Interstellar Navy -- but she is our commanding officer on the shuttle and she plays her part by the book. Her black hair is never out of place, her olive skin never has a single blemish, and her always perfectly pressed military uniform gives her air of formality. I've even developed the theory that Captain Armaan spends most of her day ironing her uniform. Even her white, form-fitting space suit with its blue highlights looks regal compared to everyone else's. Most of the crew are pretty casual and relaxed around each other, but they all stiffen up, myself included, when Captain Armaan enters the room. She leans around her seat and gives us all a hard look to indicate that yes, she does mean us and no, she has no problem with throwing us in the brig.</p>

<p>It's not uncommon for Miles to poke fun at me. I don't have much clout with him. He's a decorated soldier who fought in the Brazilian war, the last war on Earth. Miles has a medal of honor. I, on the other hand, have a degree and a bunch of textbooks, and Miles isn't big on textbooks.</p>

<p>Most of the crew, in fact, has some claim to heroism. Joy was one of the premier designers of the modern FTL, Faster Than Lightspeed, engine. Captain Armaan was part of the team of tacticians credited with bringing a swift end the Brazilian War, and back on Earth, Dr. Sandra was a battlefield nurse in the war. She saved the lives of people on both sides, and if she does nothing else with the rest of her life, she can at least be confident that she accomplished something worthwhile.</p>

<p>The back burner shuts down and the shuttle flips back around so that it faces forward. I peer through the side viewport and catch my first glimpse of the massive ship we're heading towards. The grayish white vessel is 12 kilometers long and about 1.5 kilometers wide. It has a flared, spear-like head. The main body looks skeletal with large ridges along the back and sides. There is an oblong bulge on the dorsal side that I would guess is about 3 kilometers long and takes up the entire width. A large trianiary block of engines takes up the rear, and trailing behind it is a long, serpentine tail of...what? Asteroids? Debris?</p>

<p>"Domina, we are alongside the ship. I am scanning the ID," Captain Armaan says.</p>

<p>The shuttle rotates so that the front faces the ship and we drift sideways. The shuttle's floodlights illuminate the hull, and some large Asian script painted onto the side swings into view.</p>

<p>"Uh&hellip;hm&hellip;the computer is bringing up the info now. It's the&hellip;Dang day long."</p>

<p>I count the number of seconds (about point five) before the 55 year old linguistics professor Prentice Cato, another gray-suit like me, chimes in. "D&#283;ngd&agrave;i L&oacute;ng, you imbecile," he mutters with irritation, pressing thumb and middle finger into his temples theatrically. "It means, The Waiting Dragon".</p>

<p>The captain raises her hand to her face and pinches the bridge of her nose. She takes a deep breath and then exhales slowly. "Thank you, Professor," she says with more than a hint of false civility. "Your input is always appreciated."</p>

<p>One linguist is required to be a member of the active crew to assist in communications should our ship ever encounter alien life or simply another human ship that does not primarily speak English, but since the human race has never encountered aliens, and we haven't see another Earth vessel for the entire duration of our voyage, until now, Cato doesn't do much except describe half empty water glasses to anyone in earshot. I don't know what Cato was like back on Earth, but I know him as a wrinkly, mothballed old curmudgeon whose only enjoyment in life seems to come from prescribing his pessimistic wisdom to people who would rather get stung by a bee.</p>

<p>The captain continues reading the information on the mystery ship beside us. "It is a Chinese vessel, Ark 5 class colony ship, commissioned in 2235, disembarked in 2250, had aboard 10,261 passengers and 2,185 crew, and was destined for the Orion Cluster."</p>

<p>"They must be one of the original FTL colony ships," Joy remarks. "They set sail a full fifty years before us, and we didn't start outfittin' colony ships with stasis modules until '76. That means this here is a generational ship."</p>

<p>Our ship, an Ark 7 colony ship, is a big block with engines strapped to the back. It's mainly composed of stasis pods, about ten million of them. The ship operates on a crew of twenty-two individuals who work four month shifts. Every four months, one crew comes out of stasis and the working one goes back in. There are twenty such crews, so I come out once every forty years, along with Captain Leila Arman, Lieutenant Jason Miles, Principle Engineer Joy Kekoa, Professor Prentice Cato, Dr. Lisa Sandra, and everyone else currently awake on the Domina Novum. In this way, over the course of our 200 year voyage, we only aged about five years.</p>

<p>This ship though, the Waiting Dragon, has no such system. The crew and passengers lived out their full lives on a barge which has been traveling for 250 years. That means they've seen a full nine generations live and die since they left Earth. That ship is all they know, or did know. </p>

<p>The shuttle pivots about its horizontal axis to face forward. The captain continues to read off more information about the D&#283;ngd&agrave;i L&oacute;ng. The ship has six large hangar bays holding tug boats, construction vessels, large modular blocks that fit together to make shipyards or factories, and a fleet of shuttles and terraforming ships to land on a suitable planet. It addition to the shuttles it also maintains 52 escape pods, but it's most notable feature is a multi-deck arboretum, which acts as a farm for growing vegetables and grain on the upper levels, and as a recreational area on the lower levels. It supposedly has a beach, a section that simulates mountain air, and a park-like forest. A real forest!</p>

<p>A little more than 200 years ago, after the Brazilian War, we finally started getting Earth back on track to recovering from the past 400 years of exploitation. It's amazing what human ingenuity can accomplish when it needs to. And then, something went wrong. There was a massive industrial explosion and Earth became completely uninhabitable. There was a big legal investigation into what happened, but we never heard much of it. The terraformed Mars had already suffered a similar catastrophe. In a matter of years the radiation levels on Earth would threaten its entire plant and animal ecosystem, including the remaining population of only four billion humans. Four billion seems like a low number until you find the need to relocate each and every one of them. Even with our terraforming technology, it would take a <span style='background-color: #d88'>millenium</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>millennium</span> before Earth would be safe to inhabit again. We immediately had to figure out how four billion people were going to survive without a planet.</p>

<p>There was a massive, heroic effort which created four billion stasis pods and 2000 FTL ships in just two years. We loaded almost the entire remaining population of Earth onto colony ships and sent them off. We had never positively identified any habitable planets outside of our solar system, but we had good guesses of where to find some. And that was the plan, to disperse humanity across the stars in hopes that some would find a suitable planet to colonize, because one thing was for certain: we simply did not have the capacity to accommodate four billion living, breathing humans in space stations. Most would exist only in stasis.</p>

<p>We reached our target region of space after the first fifty years, and found no planet suitable for terraforming. So for the past century and a half, we've been jumping from system to system, chasing leads, and now we're running out of fuel. Joy estimates that we have enough for 30 for 40 more jumps, or somewhere between 150 and 200 more light-years of travel left in our ship. After that, if we don't find replacement fuel, we'll be stuck floating in the dead of space until the life support systems finally fall apart.</p>

<p>"Bring us alongside the bay doors," the captain says.</p>

<p>More of the hull flashes by an opposite window. After a minute, Lieutenant 
Miles says, "Captain, are you seeing what I'm seeing?"</p>

<p>"I am..." comes the pensive response, both watching as we pass by the first civilian section of the ship, which is covered by clusters of strange nubs recessed into the surface. She pressed her hand on a comm button on the dash "Domina, so far I haven't noticed a single missing escape pod"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Explorer One, can you confirm that last message?  No escape pods have jettisoned?"</p>

<p>"That is correct." The captain pauses as we drift past a massive sealed door. "And so far all hangar doors are sealed as well. No signs of any attempt to leave. This ship is cold."</p>

<p>"Roger that, Explorer One. Continue scanning the vessel."</p>

<p>"Shit," Miles exclaims, accenting his words with a thud on the dash "We're walking into a graveyard."</p>

<p>"Now hold on a minute," Cato says, " I did not agree to join a bloody grave robbing party".</p>

<p>"Professor," Captain Armaan says with what sounds like the last straw, "as I recall, you hardly agreed to join this mission at all, and given the option, I would have chosen any other crew member over you. But as it is, the six of us are the only crew members available to execute this mission, and that's going to remain the case for the next three months. Abandoned or not, that ship probably has the fuel cells we need to keep our FTL drive running. So suck it up and do your job like the rest of us."</p>

<p>As we float past the hangar bays, our mounted flood lights flicker and dance over the giant, sealed doors. And then a ragged black pit like the open maw of a predator consumes the light.</p>

<p>"Domina, it looks like one of the hangar bay doors is open," the Captain states with a little optimism. The ship slows and rotates to face the mouth, the light still struggling to penetrate very deep into the space, sweeping left to right.</p>

<p>"Those doors aren't open," Joy says, "they're just gone.  Look how the metal bends outward on the sides. Blown clean off their rollers."</p>

<p>Along the outer hull around the bay, numerous armor plates are distorted, curled back or misplaced.  They shimmer and glint like the many hundreds of scales of some great reptile, giving the impression that the stagnant ship is shifting ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Explorer One, does it look like you can gain access to the rest of the ship through this bay?" Domina's comm officer asks.</p>

<p>"Affirmative Domina, We're making our approach now."</p>

<p>The shuttle moves forward into the dark pit. I can see the ragged edges of the bay door, like monstrous teeth ready to snap shut to devour us whole.</p>

<p>The ship settles onto the metal floor with a faint shudder, the autopilot mercifully less spasmodic than the human one. The Lieutenant watches a series of checks flick to their green status before giving the Captain the thumbs up. "Mag locks engaged, the ship is secured."</p>

<p>Captain Arman unstraps herself from the co-pilot seat, her hands holding the ceiling above her her head to steady herself as she turns to address us non-military types.</p>

<p>"Alright people. I know the state of the ship and its crew is not what we expected, but we're going to be flexible. Our mission remains the same: get to the bridge, find out what happened to the crew, and assess the state of the FTL fuel cells. This ship has been adrift for who knows how many decades, so if there was ever anything that would harm you on this ship, it's long gone."</p>

<p>A hand goes up in the cabin. "Yes, Professor, what is it?" Captain Armaan asks tiredly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, but you did say earlier that this ship is powered off, correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and?"</p>

<p>"So that would mean no life support, lights, artificial gravity, etcetera?"</p>

<p>"I hope you get to your point before we get to the bridge?" the Captain says testily.</p>

<p>Cato blinks, "How is it that you are able to stand right now?"</p>

<p>The captain stares blank-faced at Cato, then down at her feet, like she is expecting to float off the floor at any moment. Then she looks back at the lieutenant. "Miles?"</p>

<p>After a brief consultation with the console, Miles looks back at the captain. "I'm detecting an artificial gravity field local to this bay... and atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Impossible, the bay is open to space!" The captain leans over the console as if intending to inform the scanners that they're being irrational.</p>

<p>"That's what they say, Captain. The bay is protected by a force field, and we're in a pocket of standard atmo.</p>

<p>The captain turns back around to face the rest of us still strapped in our seats. "Alastar, Kekoa, any ideas as to what is going on?"</p>

<p>Joy glances my way before speaking, "Beats me. At least we know there're still fuel cells with some juice. But I've got no idea why the ship would decide to power up all of a sudden." She looks back to me again.</p>

<p>"I... well..." I stutter, "It's possible the internal sensors were in some kind of standby mode, and the AI is turning on the ship for us, basically. But really, after being adrift for decades, a ship like this should remain dormant until someone pushes the start button on the bridge."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, are the sensors picking up anything else unusual? Is there any instability in the gravity field?"</p>

<p>Miles looks over his console again. "No, Captain, the field appears to be perfectly stable."</p>

<p>The captain purses her lips and then radios in. "Domina, it looks like the ship is responding to our presence. Life support and power have returned to the bay.  We haven't determined why the ship is reactivating itself, but it does not seem to pose any threat, so we are prepared to proceed."</p>

<p>"Copy that Explorer One. Maintain radio contact."</p>

<p>"Acknowledged," Armaan replies, and then looks back at us. "Helmets on."
Everyone reaches down and pulls a narrow-necked space helmet from under their seats, each one matching the coloring of the complementary suit. Dr. Sandra twists her shoulder length hair into a bun and slips hers over her head.</p>

<p>Cato holds his in his lap, looking down doubtfully at it. "Must we really confine ourselves with these things?" he says. "We've already determined that the ship has atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Yes," Armaan replies, "but we don't know how stable it is, or if parts of the ship are in vacuum. If we're in a room that decompresses suddenly, and you remember to not hold your breath, then you will lose consciousness in less than fifteen seconds, and be dead in 3 minutes."</p>

<p>"Well then," Cato says, buckling himself back up, " perhaps I'll just hold the fort here."</p>

<p>"Prentice," Joy says. "Play nice and put the helmet on.</p>

<p>Cato grunts and slowly raises the helmet over his head.</p>

<p>I pull <span style='background-color: #d88'>myown</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>my own</span> helmet down over my head, which takes quite a bit of effort, because it's a very snug fit. After crushing my ears, I get my head past the neck piece and into the part that actually fits comfortably. The helmet seals around the neck of my suit automatically. For a brief moment, the faceplate fogs up and my breathing echoes loudly in my ears. Then the helmet powers on, the sound of my breath stops reverberating in my ears, and I can hear almost like there's no helmet at all. A heads up display flicks on, lighting up a number of green icons indicating that my suit is functioning properly. I raise my left hand in front of me and drag a virtual cartography icon to the center of my field of view. A translucent map expands, covering my whole range of vision, and with my eyes I follow a bright red line highlighting our route to the bridge. After flying 6000 kilometers from our ship to this one, the remaining walking distances is 7.4 kilometers. I lazily swipe my hand across the map, and it shrinks back into a transparent icon at the edge of my vision.</p>

<p>As the occupants rise from their chairs, the Captain walks to the back of the shuttle, grabbing a pack. "Alright people", she commands "assemble your gear.  We're moving out in two minutes."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant unstraps himself and follows the captain to the rear hatch. I push the x-harness across my chest and my lap restraint and lean over to peer out of my viewport one last time. The opaque blackness stares back. My mind keeps coming back to the idea that we have landed in the maw of some ancient beast, and we will soon be making our way into its belly.</p>

<hr />

<p>The cargo hold is crammed full of open trunks and people. Dr. Sandra already has her med kit and bio scanner in hand, while Joy and Lt. Miles load power cells and some engineering apparatus I can't identify onto a waiting hover-dolly.</p>

<p>Clamped to the ceiling against the wall are two large, orange, roughly spherical objects: our All Environment Recon Drones or AERDs. The objects are both about sixty centimeters in diameter and have a large eye protruding from the center surrounded by smaller, round and elongated eyes. Both have stubby arms retracted snuggly against the sides of their bodies.</p>

<p>"IVI," I say aloud.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Timothy," the pleasant, synthesized voice of a woman promptly responds as a green icon of any ivy plant pops up on my HUD.</p>

<p>"Please activate the AERDs and connect me to them."</p>

<p>"Of course," she replies promptly.</p>

<p>The surface of the two probes appears to ripple as two sequences of white lines traverse their orange coatings. The probes, which assist in both planetary exploration and ship maintenance, were originally designed for military reconnaissance and have adaptive camouflage skin. Two windows with blue progress bars pop up on my HUD indicating the probes' startup sequence.</p>

<p>Floodlights on the back of the shuttle illuminate the bay with a bright, white light. Then the captain and lieutenant step out together onto the ramp, the captain shining a handheld floodlight up at the ceiling revealing a grid of pipes and struts. Miles, in typical soldierly fashion, pulls his rifle from his pack and clicks on the light, scanning the room.</p>

<p>The captain looks back at us. "Let's go people! I don't want to spend the rest of my life here."</p>

<p>Sandra, Joy, and Cato step onto the ramp and into the bay, Joy pushing the cart laden with fancy equipment, which now hovers about a meter off the ground. The three of them lean back and turn slowly, taking in the scene.</p>

<p>"Alaster!" Captain Armaan hollers my way. "Are you ready yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, uh&hellip;" I look about me and grab the pack with my computer gear. "Just another second!" I promise.</p>

<p>The two clamps holding the probes release and the twin orbs float down to eye level, their primary oculars focusing on me. The full progress bars are replaced by videos of myself in my white and blue space suit with a white backpack slung over one shoulder.</p>

<p>"IVI, run the bridge mapping program," I say.</p>

<p>"Of course, Timothy," the voice responds. The two orbs dodge around me and zoom into the open bay. The video feeds give the me the feeling that I'm flying. I tromp after AERDs and stop just in front of Captain Arman, who is staring me down behind her glass faceplate, her arms akimbo. I don't meet her gaze.</p>

<p>The probes glide in calculated concert around the bay, projecting green laser lines onto the walls as they scan the structure of the hangar. After several moments they approach the nearby door.</p>

<p>"How do they fly?" someone says right behind me, and I immediately jump. I turn around and see the professor standing close to me.</p>

<p>Our helmets have a surround sound system that simulates what the world, including our comm chatter, would sound like if we weren't wearing the helmets. Sometimes it works too accurately, as Professor Cato just demonstrated. The professor though, doesn't seem to have noticed my surprise. This is actually the first time we've gotten to use the probes for anything other than ship maintenance, and Cato is watching the them with genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>"Uh, well..." I say, remembering the question and growing excited. "They use a forceless engine based on the Lorenz Repulsor Principal. It's like, if you--"</p>

<p>"Ehh, <span style='background-color: #d88'>nevermind,"</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>never mind,"</span> Cato says, as if catching himself. "I don't need to hear yet another lecture on the wonders of technology."</p>

<p>Cato, a few months back, started up a lecture series, which everyone thought was a great idea, because life aboard a starship is not nearly as exciting as Star Trek mad    e it out to be. Cato gave lectures on linguistics, which were quite possibly more boring than staring at the wall. Joy also gives lectures, which are really more like science exhibitions that frequently involve fire and explosions, and everyone loves those. People eventually stopped attending Cato's presentations.</p>

<p>The two drones arrive at the largest door, bobbing up and down as if floating in an invisible tide. The feed from one of the probes pops back up on my HUD with the red text "Passage blocked, assistance requested." I swipe my hand across my field of view, and the message shrinks back to the edge in the form of a yellow exclamation mark. Without further prompting, we all trot over to the door.</p>

<p>"Professor Cato," the captain says once we reach the door. "If you wouldn't mind &#8210; I believe this door has power."</p>

<p>Cato strides over the door's control panel, which is comprised mostly of buttons covered in some Asian script. Finding one to his liking, a button near the top with a character that looks somewhat like a square A, he casually pushes it. The door rumbles up about 90 centimeters before abruptly halting with a cringe-inducing crunch.</p>

<p>"Oh goody," Cato says sardonically.</p>

<p>The probes seem perfectly happy with this result, and one ducks under the partially opened door and zooms off with it sibling close in tow.</p>

<p>Joy steps out from behind her floating cart and gives the door a solid thump with her fist. The door gives and recedes into the ceiling, grumbling the whole way up. "So electrical systems are in good enough order to turn on the life support systems for us, but opening the front door is just too much to handle," she muses out loud. "This ship is one confused creature."</p>

<p>"It's not a creature at all," Captain Armaan retorts. "It is a mass of metal that has been adrift for God knows how long, and it holds salvageable resources. Negotiating a mostly dead ship would be difficult enough with a well-trained team, let alone one that is afraid the walls are going eat them." She fires a condescending look at each one of us before turning back to the newly revealed corridor. "Lieutenant, bring up the rear. Ensure we don't have any stragglers."</p>

<p>I raise my hand, and tap the image of the AERD icon in my HUD. The two sensor feeds swoop back into view. One of the probes is following the main access way towards the bridge. It's a wide corridor, wide enough for two service vehicles to travel in both directions and a large area for heavy pedestrian traffic. Recessed doors float by and random crates come into view before quickly zooming underneath and out of sight. And then the probe comes to an abrupt halt in front of a wall that seemingly appeared out of nowhere. There's a message on the wall that I can't read. Then the outline of the wall lights up in orange, and I can now recognize this as a blast door, a blast door ten meters wide and a meter thick, that no amount of elbow grease is ever going to loose open.</p>

<p>"The access way is blocked," I saw hollowly. The others stop, a few plugging into the AERD's feed.</p>

<p>"Kekoa," Captain Armaan says, "can we get past this?"</p>

<p>"No ma'am," Joy says without hesitation. "Those doors are only meant to close down in the event of a catastrophic breach, and are part of a system would seal the rear of the ship from the front. There are deadbolts thicker than me holding that door in place."</p>

<p>"This place is starting to get on my nerves," Miles growls.</p>

<p>I swipe the AERD feed from my view and look up at the captain. I can see here reviewing the sensor information on her HUD.</p>

<p>"Away team to Domina," the captain says, "we've run into a snag. The main access way leading to the bridge is blocked. Can you recommend an alternate route?"</p>

<p>A few seconds later a response comes back. "Away team, this is Domina. The only other way to get to the bridge is the other access way on the other side of the ship. From your position, we think the fastest way would be to go through the arboretum. We're uploading the rout to you now."</p>

<p>"Alright," grunts Armaan, who seems to have come to terms with the plan upset, "We've added another half kilometer to our trek. Let's get this over with."</p>

<p>So meter after monotonous meter, we trudge through the corridors on our way to the arboretum, or what's left of it anyway. The lights from our headlamps only chase away a small portion of the ubiquitous darkness, and the contrasting harsh gleam reflected off the gray, featureless walls does little to mitigate the general eeriness of the ship. The only sounds are the soft clapping of our boots against the metal floor and the occasional groan somewhere in the recesses of the ship that I hope is just the ancient ventilation system coming back to life. The sounds remind me of an old arthritic trying to get out of bed. The monotony soon gives way to my imagination, in which a bloodless corpse floats out in front of me &#8210; Dang it! Why did I let myself get talked into watching that horror flick last week?
I pull up on my HUD the map indicating our path, which takes us across the ship and through the back third of the giant ellipse in the middle before snaking back to the rear and towards the bridge. The remaining walking distance is 7.9 kilometers.</p>

<hr />

<p>"So, Dr. Sandra," Cato says, puffing out his chest as he walks beside the doctor, "have you had a chance to read my paper yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," Dr. Sandra replies with a polite smile, "not yet, but I will just as soon as my schedule permits."</p>

<p>"Yes, well do. There are some discoveries that I think are quite groundbreaking and that I think you, as another student of humanity, in a way, can appreciate."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Sandra says, still smiling sympathetically, "it does sound fascinating."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure it will be positively riveting, if it is anything like your lecture on the evolution of the preposition," Captain Armaan says.</p>

<p>Everyone stops and stares at the captain. Did she just make a joke? Leila Armaan just made a joke. I have never seen the captain so much as snigger even when we have comedy night in our makeshift movie theater. Up until now, I was quite certain that the erudite captain did not know the meaning of the word humor.</p>

<p>"Alright, we don't have time to gawk, people," she says in her captain's voice. "Move!"</p>

<p>We all fall back in line.</p>

<p>We eventually find ourselves in front of a closed door labeled in blue and yellow script, which my HUD translates to "Portside Concourse". After a few moments of everyone staring at him, waiting, Cato finally realizes that he's standing in front of the door controls. He begrudgingly rouses from his dark brooding, grumbling something about being the "bloody door-man", and taps at the door's control panel.</p>

<p>The LEDs on the panel blink yellow a few times before finally consenting to green. The door flies open with a thundering whoosh. Sandra and I, being the closest to the door, find ourselves airborne as a wall of air sweeps us up, and deposits us in the other room with the gracefulness of tumble dried socks.
"What on Earth was that?" Sandra asks somewhat breathlessly, rolling onto her side and getting up shakily.</p>

<p>Our headlamps shine into the darkness. Captain Armaan pulls out her handheld floodlight and casts its beam about the room, which reveals itself to be a cavernous corridor, the largest open space in the ship we've yet seen.</p>

<p>"Well," Joy begins, "I reckon there's just a pressure differential between the two areas. Maybe it takes longer to pressurize this area."</p>

<p>"So the ship turned on all of the life support systems when we landed?" Armaan asks.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Joy shrugs.</p>

<p>"I hope it doesn't deplete the last of its power reserves before we get to them."</p>

<p>"In the grand scheme of things," Joy reasons, "powering up life support for an empty ship is cheap. If that depletes the power cells, then they wouldn't have done us much good anyway."</p>

<p>"Hey, look! Trees!" I exclaim.</p>

<p>Everyone's gaze follows my outstretched hand. Two white concrete walkways, separated by a center divider, lead off into the darkness on either side of us. The center divider is covered with grass, flowers, picnic tables, and a variety of green trees.</p>

<p>"Now there's something I didn't expect to see," Joy remarks.</p>

<p>"No kidding," Sandra agrees with a hint of awe as we walk up to the greenery.
I step onto the shimmering grass. Rather than a soft give, I feel and hear a sharp crunch. Lifting my boot off the ground, I notice that my footprint has turned into green sludge. Sandra kneels next to me, drawing her gloved hand across the grass. When she lifts it, the glove is covered in green shards. She rubs her fingers together and they dissolve away.</p>

<p>"It's entirely frozen," she says, looking at the other plants, all of which have an odd sparkling quality to them, "They're all -- frozen." We all stare at the still life view set before us, almost too silent.</p>

<p><em>CRACK!</em></p>

<p>I spin on the spot. In the glare of our head lamps stands Miles, fumbling with a large branch he had just moments ago been leaning against.  A cascade of broken leaves and branches showers down upon him. He looks our way, "What?"</p>

<p>The tree beside him sways as much as its brittle insides can manage. Then I hear a much louder crack, and a deep fissure appears near the base. The tree seems to consider its options for a brief moment before the crack strafes down the side of the tree, shearing across the grain of the bark.</p>

<p>"Get back!" Armaan calls. The rest of us step back in stunned silence as the trunk gives a final crack, the whole body shaking as it is liberated from the roots, and comes crashing into the ground. Bits of trunk burst out from the former tree, scattering across the concrete walkway opposite us. The sound of exploding tree echoes through the passage for far longer than seems necessary.</p>

<p>After verifying that everyone is present and intact, Armaan stalks over to Miles, who is still holding the branch in hand. Armaan snatches the branch from his hand and brandishes it at him like an especially large, accusing finger. She contorts her mouth, as if trying to decide the best approach to harangue him, but she can't quite settle on one. Eventually, she throws down the branch, which shatters like glass. "Let's move, preferably without waking up the dead again."</p>

<p>The captain moves off, allowing the rest of us the opportunity to give Miles our looks of disappointment in his behavior.</p>

<p>"Shut up," he says, and turns to follow the captain.</p>

<p>We walk around the fallen tree, crunching through frozen grass and flowers and careful to avoid other tall objects that might try to fall on us. After crossing the second walkway, we come to a large archway outlining a door made of dark, tinted glass: the entrance to the arboretum.</p>

<div class="file">File: source/02-chapter2.md</div>

<h1>The Arboretum</h1>

<p>The control for the door to the arboretum is dead, so Joy hooks up one of the power packs in her floating cart to an outlet so that Cato can key open the door. The two AERDs return from their excursions and wait patiently above our heads for the door to open. Instead of retracting up or parting in the center, the entire archway slowly rotates about the middle and the first thing I notice is a dull light peeking around the opening. As the opening widens, some large green ferns caught by the rotating door pull free and spring back across the entryway. I can see a sky, pale blue and dotted with two or three pinpricks of white light. There are trees &#8210; lush, green-leafed trees. The archway has reached the midpoint of its rotation and now ushers us out of our world of glass and steel into a land of grass and forests. The sky, because what else do you call it, is a bright yellow towards the far horizon as if dawn is approaching.</p>

<p>Greens of every shade flood my vision. There are tall trees with branches arching over the forest floor like giant umbrellas; there are dark green, conical trees pointing up to the sky, there are shorter, round trees with yellow-tinged leaves, ferns with long, spindly leaves, and plants with leaves that I could wrap around my whole body like a blanket. There are even hills in the distance, completely covered in vegetation. And songbirds. I can hear more twitters, chirps, whistles, kip-kips and warbles than I have ever before heard in my life. A flock of tiny, green and yellow feather balls flutters away from a nearby shrub. In one of the taller, pale-barked trees, a toucan stares down at us with one eye. I can even hear, not too far off, the sound of flowing water. Never before in my life have I seen such life and vitality. The earth beneath my feet is moist and spongy. I dig my feet in it, covering the tops of my sterile, white boots with black earth. If only I could feel the earth between my toes and the fresh air in my lungs. I have breathed machine recycled air for five years. This here is what humans were meant to breathe.</p>

<p>"Didn't someone say there were no life-signs on this ship?" Cato says sardonically.</p>

<p>I tear my eyes away from the uplifting beauty and glance at Dr. Sandra, who is staring agape with wonder at the landscape. After a moment she starts to answer.</p>

<p>"Uh, well...there weren't," she says. She too finally manages to tear her eyes away and pulls out her bioscanner. "The sensors must have been unable to scan this chamber." She studies the handheld bioscanner and shrugs. "They're showing up now."</p>

<p>"So what else did the sensors not pick up?" Lt. Miles asks darkly, clearly not as enraptured by this jewel of nature as Dr. Sandra and I. Come to think of it, his last experience in a place like this might have been Hell's Forest, in which case, I can understand why he might not be so keen about this one. Yet, without hesitation the lieutenant takes point, stepping a dozen paces ahead of the group to scan the nearby vegetation. Nothing phases that guy.</p>

<p>"Away team to <strong>Domina</strong>," Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan</span> radios in. "We've reached the arboretum and have encountered...life. It would appear that this part of the ship is shielded from our sensors."</p>

<p>Everyone looks away from the vista to the captain when there's no response.</p>

<p>"<strong>Domina</strong>, do you copy?"</p>

<p>Joy remarks, "If the walls in this section can block our sensors, it's a safe bet they're blocking the radio too."</p>

<p>"Why would that much shielding be necessary for the arboretum?" Armaan asks impatiently, trying the radio again. "<strong>Domina</strong>, do you read?"</p>

<p>"The Waiting Dragon was a sub-light vessel," Joy explains. "It traveled in real space at near light speed. At that kind of speed, you become very worried about the background radiation. I assume they added additional shielding to the arboretum to, above all, protect the plants and people they would be bringing for their terraforming and colonization effort on an alien planet."</p>

<p>The captain doesn't seem pleased. "Why didn't anyone mention this?"</p>

<p>Joy shrugs "Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, except the arboretum's repeaters are offline. I should have thought of that."</p>

<p>Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan</span> waits another few seconds to see if the comms officer from the <strong>Domina</strong> responds,  then gestures back to the entrance. "Alright, get the door back open."</p>

<p>My heart sinks. I don't want to leave.</p>

<p>Joy steps through a thick cluster of ferns and uses her hip to push some young trees in front of the panel out of her way. She pulls a few strands of vine off the control panel itself and then stops. "Yeah, that's going to be a bit of a problem."</p>

<p>"In what way?" the captain replies.</p>

<p>"Well, these vines," she says, yanking on a particularly sturdy strand, of which there are many climbing up the outer wall, "have done a number on the control mechanism. I can probably hot wire the door to open, but it'll take time."</p>

<p>Captain Armaan reaches her hand up to her head to pinch the bridge of her nose, but her hand runs into the glass faceplate of her helmet. Uttering a frustrated sigh, she puts her hands on her hips instead. </p>

<p>Lt. Miles steps closer to the captain and inclines his head. "If we proceed as planned, we can radio <strong>Domina</strong> when we reach the other side. They'll figure out that this place is shielded and assume we've continued on with our mission."</p>

<p>"It could take hours to trek through this jungle," the captain responds, with an agitated gesticulation at the occlusive line of trees and brush, "at which point the commander will assume something has happened to us."</p>

<p>"It's not like he can do anything besides wait anyway," Miles says. "There are probably old trails running through this forest that will make the trek easier, and Tim's probes can find them for us. I estimate one hour to reach the other side." </p>

<p>"One hour for a team of soldiers, not this motley crew," she replies, more as a resignation than a protestation. "Still, we have to reach the bridge one way or another. Cato," she says. "Look up the information on this ship tell me if the crew of the D&#283;ngd&agrave;i L&oacute;ng brought any predators with them. <span style='background-color: #d88'>Alastor,"</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Alaster,"</span> she says, turning around and pointing her chin at me. Find us something that can pass for a trail to a starboard side exit, and have one of the probes scan that route carefully. I don't want to run into any surprises."</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain," I say. I point my finger at the map icon, but pause. "Uh, Captain." She turns back and looks at me. "Can we take our helmets off now?" </p>

<p>She looks at me with some emotion akin to sympathy, then says, "No."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Alaster. We have no idea what kind of contagions might be present. Until we have tested every plant, rock, and cubic meter of air, we proceed as if this ship were alien."</p>

<p>"If there are any predators," Miles observes, "all this racket the birds are making can give us an early warning. They'll all go silent when a predator is stalking."</p>

<p>"I want the other probe continually circling around us, too." The captain orders. "I want to know about anything in our vicinity larger than a squirrel."</p>

<p>"According to the official records," Cato says, "the D&#283;ngd&agrave;i L&oacute;ng carried only non-poisonous plants and small animals, mostly birds, insects, a few lizard species, some small mammals, and fish. Of course, we don't know what the crew brought on surreptitiously." 
"Security on the early colony ships was extremely tight,
" Joy says. "If it's not on the manifest, it wasn't brought on board. Looks like you're not going to get too much excitement, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Fine by me," Miles says dispiritedly.</p>

<p>The AERDs locate the remains of a packed trail through the forest, and soon I find myself on an expedition to the heart of a jungle. The trail is now overgrown with ferns and wide-leafed plants coming up over my head. We move single file along the narrow, winding path, pushing thin-stalked plants and low hanging vines out of our way. The ground quickly turns to mud, and walking becomes more strenuous now that the ground doesn't seem to want to let go of my boots. It's sweaty work, but after spending five years sitting around on a metal ship, where the only exercise was in a dismal gym I hardly ever visited, and the only scenery was found on holoscreens, this is a welcome adventure. Just six hours ago I was doing yet another astrosensor calibration for the fiftieth time. That mundane existence seems like a lifetime ago now. It's amazing. Even on Earth, I never did something like this, not that there were many opportunities. Only on a starship two hundred lightyears from Earth do I finally get to experience a rainforest first hand.</p>

<p>After about ten minutes or so, Captain Armaan calls us to a stop in a clearing of sorts, or at least a spot with shorter plants and less dense foliage. Everyone is breathing heavily, that is, everyone except Captain Armaan and Lieutenant Miles, who stand there looking as if they've done nothing more than taken a morning stroll on a paved sidewalk. I tap a blue virtual icon in the shape of a water droplet and a tube inside my helmet with a bite nozzle telescopes over to my mouth. I take a long draught of water. The moisture-absorbing glands throughout my suit continuously clean the perspiration off my skin. A brief puff of moist air on my face, followed by another dry puff clears away the dried sweat on my forehead and the moisture creeping into my eyes.</p>

<p>Dr. Sandra, who seems among us four civilians to be in the best shape, spins around slowly, taking in the verdure surrounding us. "It must take a great amount of power to sustain a bio-dome this size. How has everything in here not only survived, but thrived for the past quarter of a millennium?"</p>

<p>"The power required is a pittance compared to what an Lightspeed Drive needs," Joy says. "Granted, over 250 years, it adds up to a lot, but the power draw is very low compared to accelerating to light speed. The ship can absorb the necessary power to keep this arboretum running from a nearby star, hence the massive solar collectors."</p>

<p>"I don't remember seeing any solar collectors when we landed," I say.</p>

<p>"They're retracted now," Joy explains. "They extend like wings when the ship approaches a star. I've heard it's quite the display."</p>

<p>"Everyone, look, over there," Dr. Sandra whispers excitedly, pointing between a gap in the trees. I turn and look.</p>

<p>Only about a meter away are a tangle of viny plants covered with small, dark green leaves and deep-throated red flowers, and bobbing in and out among the flowers are three hummingbirds with long, royal blue tail feathers and black and red stripes down their backs. One of them looks at us, trills lightly, and then goes back to his meal of nectar.</p>

<p>As we watch, a majestic butterfly the size of my two hands put together, colored with swirls of red, blue, and green, flutters down and lands on Dr. Sandra's shoulder. Dr. Sandra pulls a thin, sleek device out of her side pack and hands it to Miles. "Jason, take a picture," she whispers.</p>

<p>Miles deftly and silently hooks his rifle on his backpack and takes the device, holding it up in front of Dr. Sandra and her butterfly. When he hands the camera back, as if knowing that its mission is complete, the butterfly alights and flits away into the forest.</p>

<p>As we continue our hike, I spot a small furry creature about three meters off the ground in a tree only a couple of meters off the trail. Its enormous, curious eyes take up nearly the whole top half of the head, and it's tiny, grasping hands wrap around the thin branch it's perched upon. I've seen pictures of such creatures before, but I have no idea what they're called. The fuzz ball slowly turns its head as it follows my halting movement forward. It's really cute.</p>

<p>Looking up through the canopy of light green leaves, I can see patches of sky that are turning a deep blue. A neon blue dragonfly with a wingspan the width of my head zooms over my shoulder and on up the path ahead. As I watch it fly, I see bits of sunlight peek around the tapering tree trunks and rich foliage. The scattering of sunbeams give the forest a magical quality. White, dinner plate sized mushrooms grow off a fallen trunk, and little, round, yellow cottage shaped mushrooms pop up in small communities here and there along the peat covered forest floor.</p>

<p>After marching along for forty-five minutes, we come to a relatively large clearing with dry-ish ground.</p>

<p>"We'll rest for five minutes, everyone," Captain Armaan says. "I want to make it to the other side without any more stops."</p>

<p>Cato grunts, stomps over to a mid-sized tree, plops down in front of it, and leans back against the dry bark.</p>

<p>I look around, trying to spot more hidden critters in the trees and shrubbery. I can't find any. The trees, which tower over us now, seem darker and somehow more forbidding. Dark clouds obscure the once blue sky. The space between the trees has turned black, veiling the forest outside of our glade. The scene is familiar, like something out of a movie, a very eerie movie. I can't quite place it though.</p>

<p>Captain Armaan is subtly tapping the air in front of her, doing something on her HUD. Miles patrols the perimeter, shining his rifle light into the shadows. Joy pulls off strands of vine and leaf that have gotten caught in the seams of her floating cart. Dr. Sandra meanders about with her bioscanner, inspecting the various shrubs scattered about the glen.</p>

<p>"Tim," Dr. Sandra says after a minute, "Did the probes scan this area?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think so," I say, walking forward so that the tree she's behind doesn't block her from view. I pull up the scans from the AERDs.</p>

<p>"And they didn't come across anything&hellip;unfamiliar?"</p>

<p>I scroll through the scan summary. "No, it doesn't look like it. How come?"</p>

<p>"Because there is a flower here, and it's definitely not from Earth."</p>

<p>I swipe the scan summary from my view and stop in my tracks. Dr. Sandra is standing in the center of a perfectly clear, perfectly circular area about five meters in diameter, covered with stubby grass. And directly in front of Dr. Sandra is a meter tall, glowing object in the shape of a flower, a flower I'm quite certain I've never seen before.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure my heart misses a full beat, and for a few seconds my vision tunnels. The captain is by her side in two seconds, and even Cato is on his feet, scurrying over to get a look.</p>

<p>"You're absolutely certain," Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan</span> asks.</p>

<p>"I ran a DNA test," Dr. Sandra replies. "There is nothing on Earth that even remotely resembles it."</p>

<p>"Could it have been engineered?" Joy asks.</p>

<p>I join the huddle surrounding Dr. Sandra's discovery. The plant, if it can be called that, has five fluorescent blue leaves, each about 45 centimeters across surrounding three blue stalks, each about five centimeters thick and twisting around each other. At the top are two neon pink petals, both the size of the leaves and cordate, with the points at the base of the flower head. The petals curl back at the ends, giving the flower the appearance of a set of open jaws.</p>

<p>"No," Dr. Sandra replies. "The DNA of an engineered plant would have genes clearly spliced together from known organisms. There are no patterns consistent with any organism in the database. No, this is the work of an alien evolutionary process."</p>

<p>An alien plant. Which means the crew of the D&#283;ngd&agrave;i L&oacute;ng found a planet that supports life, life compatible with our own environment. They might be the only colonists to have discovered alien anything more complicated than bacteria. So why isn't this ship at that planet now?</p>

<p>I hear a tink-tink as it begins to sprinkle, showering our armored space suits with tiny water droplets. The water streaks off my glass faceplate without any residue. Everyone steps back from the flower, except for Miles. Miles is staring at the glowing flower, his eyes wide, and his rifle trembles in his hands.</p>

<p>"Miles?" I say.</p>

<p>He immediately breaks out of his trance and swings his rifle to point at me, a wild look in his face.</p>

<p>I stumble backwards, trip over my feet, and land on my rear.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant!" Captain Armaan shouts.</p>

<p>Miles swivels on the spot and aims his rifle at the captain.</p>

<p>"Lower your weapon, Lieutenant," Captain Armaan commands in a dangerous voice.</p>

<p>After a second, Miles slowly points his rifle at the ground.</p>

<p>"What the hell is the matter with you, Lieutenant?" the captain demands.</p>

<p>"I&hellip;something feels wrong." Miles mutters.</p>

<p>"No shit something feels wrong!" Captain Armaan thunders. "You just threatened a civilian under your protection and your commanding officer!" She stomps towards the quavering lieutenant, but Dr. Sandra puts a hand out to stop her.</p>

<p>"Captain, listen," she says, looking around at the trees.</p>

<p>"What?" the captain demands furiously.</p>

<p>"The birds. I don't hear them anymore."</p>

<p>The captain also looks around, listening, and then pulls out her sidearm and cocks it. "Group together everyone. I want us moving. Now."</p>

<p>Suddenly, something from within the shrouded depths of the forest gives a tremendous and unholy screech. We all jerk and fretfully look about ourselves, trying to identify the source. Then a black shadow jets down from the trees above us. The captain lets off a single shot before the shadow clips her on the head and disappears into the darkness of the trees. Miles rushes up to the prone captain, shouting like a maniac and firing his fully automatic weapon after the shadow.</p>

<p>Joy and Dr. Sandra race over and kneel next to the captain.</p>

<p>"Tim,' Joy shouts at me, "find us a way outta here."</p>

<p>I stare back at her, my mouth hanging open stupidly, fully understanding what she is requesting of me and fully incapable of moving.</p>

<p>"Tim!" she shouts again. She quickly gives up on me. "IVI," she commands. "Where's the nearest exit?...Have one probe stay three meters ahead and lead us to the exit. Have the other one shoot that thing that just attacked us."</p>

<p>IVI's voice speaks inside my helmet. "Combat engagement requires authorization by a senior military officer."</p>

<p>"Our senior military officer just got clobbered!" Joy argues.</p>

<p>"Combat engagement&ndash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" Joy yells.</p>

<p>Joy and Dr. Sandra lift the captain's limp body onto the floating engineering cart as one of the AERDs, a blotchy gray to match the sky, zooms down from above and stops exactly three meters in front of Joy and Dr. Sandra. It's skin ripples into a bright orange.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" Joy hollers.</p>

<p>Cato comes up behind me and hauls me to my feet. Joy shoves the cart forward as fast has her stocky legs will allow.  Dr. Sandra keeps one hand on the side of the cart and the other on Captain Armaan's shoulder to keep her from slumping off the side. Cato pushes me after them and I run, with Miles and Cato close in tow.</p>

<p>The thing utters another high pitched scream from behind us, and Miles fires a few rounds through the air as he runs. Ahead, the probe takes a sharp right around a thick coppice. Without hardly slowing, Joy and Sandra veer the cart around the same corner. I follow just a few meters behind.</p>

<p>Up ahead a fallen tree, three meters thick and with about a meter of space underneath it blocks our path. The probe zooms underneath.</p>

<p>As Joy runs, she mashes a button on the cart's control panel. The cart drops to only a few centimeters off the ground, and Leila's legs slide off before Sandra catches and repositions her. The three of them disappear underneath the tree. I slide feet first after them, splattering myself with mud. A large glop obscures my right side field of view.  Cato scrambles forward on his hands and knees. There is a short, sharp rasp, so loud that clap my hands against the sides of my helmet in an attempt to block out the sound. A red icon pops up briefly indicating that the volume has been reduced to protect my hearing.</p>

<p>Miles screams a maniacal battle cry and fires a steady stream of bullets. The tree groans as something heavy hits it. A moment later, Miles scrambles past, dropping an empty clip and reloading his rifle. I hear something grasping and clawing at the trunk above us.</p>

<p>Miles and I both get out from under the tree and charge after Cato, who is wheezing along a few meters ahead of us. Then the dark shadow shoots overhead with that horrible, blood-curdling shriek, just missing my head. The shadow tackles Cato's legs from underneath him, and Cato lands flat on his back. Miles fires wildly in the creature's direction, and it disappears once again into a thicket of ferns. I reach down and grab one of Cato's arms as I near him, and then the shadow darts out from the surrounding undergrowth again and rams Miles in the chest. He spins and lands on top the creature. A long, black leg punches Miles in the stomach, and he flies back a couple of meters, landing on his haunches. He pulls his sidearm and fires repeatedly at the creature, which in a split second vanishes back into the trees.</p>

<p>Cato and I race forward. Just ten meters away is a small rectangular door with vines hanging off and Joy beckoning us from within. "Run!" she shouts.</p>

<p>I push Cato forward as fast my stiff, heavy legs will allow. We are a meter away when something with immense momentum takes my legs from underneath me. I twist through the air and crash straight into Joy. With a heavy crack, the door slams shut behind me. I scramble up with Joy and look over to Sandra who his crouching protectively over the captain. The creature is outside. I'm safe. Then I look around again. Cato and Miles are not with us.</p>

<p>I hear more gunfire from outside, and then someone bangs on the door.</p>

<p>"Open the door! Open the door!" Cato shouts desperately.</p>

<p>Joy is at the control panel, mashing buttons. "It's not working!" she cries. She wrenches the control panel from the wall revealing the circuitry underneath.</p>

<p>The walls between this room and the arboretum are a dark, transparent glass. I spot a tall flight of steel stairs next to the glass and run part way up. The floor above connects to a balcony and a set of catwalks stretching out over the canopy of the forest. I spot a tangle of thick, knotted vines hanging down from a section of catwalk a few meters away.</p>

<p>"Miles, Cato!" I say urgently. "There is a vine hanging down about 15 meters starboard of your position. I think you can climb up."</p>

<p>"Which bloody way is starboard?!" Cato shrieks. But Miles is already running towards the vine, firing shots off behind him. I run up the rest of the stairs as Cato spots Miles and scampers after him. The creature leaps from the trees at Miles, who fires an unbroken stream of bullets at the enigmatic shadow. The creature hits the ground and instantly leaps back into the cover of the forest.</p>

<p>Then Miles' rifle runs out of bullets.  Cato is almost to him, but the creature shrieks again, and Miles lets the rifle swing to his side by the shoulder strap and starts climbing the vine. Miles is already two meters off the ground when Cato starts climbing, who to my surprise moves up the vine at as fast as the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The area I'm in, from the quick glance I spare, is some kind of observation deck. Leading to the catwalks is a set of glass doors to which I can find no control panel. I push on them, but they won't open.</p>

<p>Then two black shadows zoom across the forest floor from different directions and appear at the foot of the vine. The light illuminates their hard-shelled bodies. They remind me at once of giant, black grasshoppers. Their hind legs are twice the length of the rest of their bodies, their knees bent high in the air. Their front four legs are half the length of the rear ones and are fingered like a chimpanzee's. On their heads are four enormous eyes, two in the front and two in the back. And protruding from their long snouts are four 15 centimeter long fangs, two curving down from the top, and two curving up from the lower jaw.</p>

<p>Miles fires two shots from his pistol before that runs out too, which the two grasshopper creatures seem to have no trouble dodging.</p>

<p>Then Miles says hysterically over the radio, "The vine! It's starting to fray! I don't think it can hold both of us!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't stop! Keep climbing you fool!" Cato shouts from below him.</p>

<p>"I can't! The vine will break!" Miles roars.</p>

<p>Miles is two meters from the top, and Cato five. The creatures are prowling around the base of the vine like panthers, their knees swinging back and forth as they walk. Why are they just waiting? They could easily jump up and catch them.</p>

<p>With a sinking feeling I realize that now only one of them can escape the clutches of the creatures. Either both will fall, or one of them will have to drop down and sacrifice himself to save the other. But the creatures couldn't possibly understand that.</p>

<p>Miles pulls out a large knife from its sheath on his leg. He then reaches down to press the knife against the vine underneath him. "I'm sorry Professor" he says shakily.</p>

<p>"What? No. No!" Cato screams. With one clean swipe, Miles cuts the vine below him. Still clinging to the vine and screaming with all the force his lungs can provide, Cato falls six meters to the ground and lands with a sickening thud before his comm stops transmitting. One of the creatures grabs Cato with two of its front legs and in an instant disappears into the forest, with its companion following a moment later. </p>

<p>And just like that, Cato is gone. I stare into the forest canopy, watching Miles dangle from the severed vine. It's all gone wrong.</p>

<div class="file">File: source/03-chapter3.md</div>

<h1>Gravity</h1>

<p>I open my mouth to report to the others, but no words come. My brain feels stuck in a loop watching a man plummet to his death, a man condemned by a simple slash of a blade. The world seems to spin around me and I fall to my knees. The sound of Cato's body striking the forest floor <span style='background-color: #d88'>echos</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>echoes</span> in my head. The sight of his limp corpse being dragged into the underbrush replays repeatedly in my mind. Cato.</p>

<p>A sound like a high pitched squeak heard underwater brushes my ears, but I don't have the focus to heed it. The room seems to grow impossibly large. I feel so small and alone. I am cold, but my body is slick with sweat, and a painful nausea in my stomach forces me to double over, sending me to my hands and knees.  </p>

<p>There are footsteps. Bodies rush past my field of vision. I should recognize them, but I only see a series of blurs.  One of the blurs starts speaking louder and more frantically as it reaches the observation window, giving orders. The sound becomes sharper and clearer. Another moves quickly towards me, grabbing and steadying me.</p>

<p>"Tim.... Tim, look at me sweetie," comes a voice I recognize. The face of Doctor Sandra resolves sharply before me as she gives me a shake, her face etched with worry. I'm not sure how to respond to this. The next shake causes my helmet to bump hers and I blink a few more times.</p>

<p>I move my lips, but still no sound utters from them. I take a deep breath and force the words out. "Cato, he fell..." I croak. I feel like an iron claw has gripped my heart, and I clench up again, unable to speak. Sandra pales, and she looks out the window beside me to where the Captain, who has a nasty cut above her brow but seems otherwise intact, is helping a visibly shaken Lieutenant onto the catwalk.</p>

<p>"Just take deep breaths, Tim," Sandra says softly. I obey and the nausea slowly shrinks back as my suit dries my skin. Dr. Sandra walks over to Joy to ensure that she is unharmed. I change position, sitting on the floor with my arms loosely wrapped around my knees, and follow the lieutenant with my eyes, who is quietly giving a report to Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman.</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan.</span> I remain silent, that is, until Miles describes how the rope "snapped" and Cato fell.</p>

<p>"That's not how it happened!" I say louder than I had planned. I pause, looking to Sandra, who just stares rather blank-faced back at me. "You cut the rope, Miles. I saw it."</p>

<p>"Bullshit!" Miles explodes. The soldier's face reddens in anger. "I said the line couldn't hold us. It didn't. Cato didn't make it."</p>

<p>"That's a serious accusation", the captain says tightly, her eyes drilling into me.</p>

<p>It occurs to me suddenly that if Miles denies it, I may not be able to convince the captain of the truth. I look back to Dr. Sandra again, who is still watching blank-faced, and then to Joy, who looks dubious. I am alone in this, and it is no small thing to accuse a soldier, especially Miles, of lying. And again, it occurs to me that Miles might try to kill me to cover himself. Who know what he is capable of, I could end up <strong>_</strong> or worse.</p>

<p>I could stay silent to protect myself. No. All my life I have been taught to stand up for the oppressed, that I am my brother's keeper. If I back down now, I will be nothing more than a hypocrite and a coward.</p>

<p>"I saw him." I say, my voice trembling. "He said... said 'I'm sorry', and then cut the vine above the professor. The professor fell to the ground, about five meters, and the creatures disappeared with him.</p>

<p>Miles looks to the others before rounding on me, his face growing redder. "What I want to know is why your DAMNED machines didn't see those things until they were right on top of us?" He spat. "Well? You said it was safe!"</p>

<p>"I said it looked safe!" I reply. I start sweating again, and my throat protests against further speech. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. "The probes didn't pick them up at first. I don't know why. But that doesn't make what I said less true!"</p>

<p>Miles' expression morphs into a snarl as he clenches his fist.</p>

<p>"Alright ENOUGH!" Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan</span> snaps, coming between us and shoving the lieutenant back.</p>

<p>Miles simply stares at me before looking back at the Captain.</p>

<p>"This will accomplish nothing." The captain says. "We still have a mission to complete, and I need all of you in order to complete it." She again attempts to pinch the bridge of her nose, fails, and slams her fist against the wall. She closes her eyes for a moment before giving her orders.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give a report to <strong>Domina</strong>. Miles, get over here" she says turning her back on us and walking down to the lower level. Miles stomps after her. Sandra still seems dumbstruck, and Joy turns to gaze out the panoramic window.</p>

<p>I feel so useless. My stomach cramps up at the thought of Cato and I tear my eyes away from the forested scene. My hands mechanically move to bring up the twin views from the AERDs, which are hanging mid-air downstairs. I order them to return to me.</p>

<p>As one approaches the stairwell, its NFC radio picks up a conversation. I can't help but slow the silent machine, letting it linger over the voices. The probe turns and brings the captain and Miles into view. They are tucked away in a corner, out of sight from everyone but the probe. Their voices are hushed, but I am able to make out most of what they say.</p>

<p>"...don't know." comes Miles' voice</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you don't know?" The captain's replies. "Did you or did you not cut the rope. It's as easy as that.</p>

<p>"You know I wouldn't..."</p>

<p>"God damnit I know you wouldn't. I'm asking if you DID."</p>

<p>Miles shifts uneasily, staring at his feet and then out the window at the forest floor. "It all feels wrong. Everything was wrong.  I...I might have, I don't KNOW!" The hot anger from before is now tempered by something weaker: despair.</p>

<p>The two lapse into harsher whispers, but soon the captain says "We'll deal with this later. I can't afford to lose you Miles, not now. But so help me if you begin to feel things are 'wrong' again and don't tell me&hellip;you'd be better off like Cato."</p>

<p>The two return to our group. I quickly and guiltily switch on my map, staring but not really seeing. The captain breaks the silence.</p>

<p>"Okay everyone, listen up. I know you are all distraught, and to ask you to continue on is more than should ever have been expected of you. But the fact remains that unless we finish our mission, the <strong>Domina Novum</strong> is going to end up dead in the water. We are never going to find a new home, and Professor Cato will have died for nothing. So we press on. Collect yourselves; we move out in five minutes."</p>

<p>I'm still staring at the map. I finally manage to focus on our current position: 6.5 kilometers to the bridge.</p>

<hr />

<p>The hiss of the door rising into the wall is the only noise besides our footsteps that I hear. The comms are dead silent as we walk down a corridor heading towards the starboard officers' mess. Sandra walks beside me, her face set, but I can see the remnants of tears on her cheeks. The curiosity and excitement from the arboretum is gone.</p>

<p>The next set of doors leads us down a hallway that is covered with glass on one side, looking into a vast, dark space. Our headlamps pierce the darkness, revealing dim tiling twenty or so meters below. From my short research of the ship's structure, this must be the main concourse, essentially a town center slash shopping mall where the people's needs were met in the form of stores, groceries, entertainment and socializing, all done in this vast hall large enough to hold well over a thousand of the occupants at once.</p>

<p>But no one takes much in. We all just keep walking on after cursory glances if that, except for Doctor Sandra, who pauses at the glass, placing a gloved hand on the barrier, staring down at the floor as if looking into the ship's past.</p>

<p>"It's hard to believe..." she begins "But this was once the home of thousands of colonists. This wasn't just a ship they stayed on, it was their whole life. They were born, lived, and... died... on this ship" she says. I can hear more than a tinge of emotion in her voice. The glass wall gives an almost imperceptible tremor, and Sandra looks at me to see if I also felt it. I nod my head.</p>

<p>The shudder repeats, but this time the whole floor shakes. We both take an instinctive step back from the glass.</p>

<p>"What was that?" the Captain's voice cuts through the trailing silence. No one is quick to offer up an answer.</p>

<p>At a pointed glance towards Joy, the engineer just shrugs "Could be any number of things" she says "We're wakin' up all manner of systems just by entering new sectors."</p>

<p>I sense more than hear the four others hold their collective breath as we wait for more signs of trouble, but none come.</p>

<p>"Let's move," the Captain says calmly as she pushes forward.</p>

<p>We continue down the corridor and stop next to a closed double door. Armaan keys open the door this time, which slides sideways into the wall. Our headlamps shine into the darkness, the circles of light dancing off a number of metal chairs and a waxed marble floor. Above the open doorway is a line of black lettering, unrecognizable to me, but my HUD overlays it with "Lower Officer's Mess". Miles, who seems calm and focused now, leads the way in.</p>

<p>I glance over at Sandra. She's seems transfixed by the words above the door. I look back at it and notice an icon strangely reminiscent of the flower in the arboretum.</p>

<p>"That's weird," I say. "I wonder if that symbol means something." I look back to Sandra, who hasn't moved. "Sandra?"</p>

<p>"Hm? Oh," she says, breaking out of her trance. "I was just...thinking, I guess."</p>

<p>I raise an eyebrow at her, but she doesn't seem to notice and follows behind Joy into the room. I shrug and enter as well.</p>

<p>Inside, our headlamps reveal rows and rows of tables, enough to accommodate about 500 people. Though the nearest few tables are completely devoid of any accouterments, the nearer the tables get to the registers the more plates, cups and bowls I see. Many are on the floor, the contents now just dust. A large number of plates and silverware are set in their proper places on the table completely untouched.</p>

<p>The ceiling lights nearest to us glow faintly before flickering on, filling the room with a sterile light. It seems that this section has more power than some others.</p>

<p>"It's like they just got up and left," Joy says. "Where in heaven's name did these people go?"</p>

<p>A shimmering glint catches my eye and my gaze settles on a mug on the floor. It must have just fallen during the small quake. It's still spinning a few centimeters from the ground, just rotating lazily in the air, almost completely stationary besides the rotation, its shiny surface casting shifting shadows and reflections on the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh shit," exclaims Joy. At that moment, the entire room rumbles and shakes violently, but after one massive jolt, the shaking stops. Bowls and plates lift into the air and a feeling of vertigo fills my stomach as my feet leave the ground. I hear a series of deep clunks, as if some giant breakers are flipping off. The room plunges into darkness again for a brief moment before our headlamps automatically switch back on. Chairs and silverware tumble through the air, the mess hall becoming a confusing mire of metal and plastics.</p>

<p>"We need to get out of here now!" calls Joy in an urgent tone that snaps us to the situation at hand. "Captain, the artificial gravity system is in flux."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" Dr. Sandra exclaims.</p>

<p>The door we had just come through slams shut. Then, as if to illustrate Joy's point, everything comes crashing back down to the floor. But the center of a table only five meters away instantly crumbles when it hits the floor. Its glass cups shatter and flatten as if stepped on by a giant, invisible foot, and the floor beneath it tears and forms a sink hole.</p>

<p>"Everyone, move! To the back!" the captain shouts. The captain and Joy take the lead, racing towards the kitchen in the back of the mess hall opposite the way we came in.</p>

<p>Suddenly, both at once, Joy and Captain <span style='background-color: #d88'>Arman's</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Armaan's</span> feet leave the ground and they go sailing through the air, waving their arms in circles to keep from tumbling end over end. Sandra, Miles, and I slide to a stop, gravity still anchoring us to the ground.</p>

<p>The captain manages to hook her foot around the leg of one of the tables and stabilize herself. She turns back to us. "Keep moving!" she yells angrily. "Try to push off to the other side."</p>

<p>Before any of us can move, the tables and chairs between us and the captain catapult upwards and smash into the ceiling. A second later, the three of us along along with a few of the surrounding tables follow. Miles manages to land on his feet, but Sandra and I both end up on our backs. My suit protects me a little, but my gut cramps up when the wind is knocked out of me. Miles helps Sandra to her feet, and I get up on my own.</p>

<p>The captain and Joy, who are swimming through the maze of twisting furniture towards the kitchen, are sucked back down to the ground, or what is now my ceiling. Our two groups stare at each other in what is probably the most surreal experience I've ever had. We're only about ten meters away from each other, but the one group is lying on the floor while the other is standing on the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Come on," Miles says. "Keep your body low and be ready to twist around and land on your feet with your knees bent if the gravity switches again." Sandra and I obey, and Miles goes before us, navigating around the fallen tables and scattered chairs, looking back every few seconds to make sure we're following.</p>

<p>Joy and the captain make it to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Kekoa," the captain commands, "Find find a way to kill the power to this section!"</p>

<p>Joy disappears through the door, while the captain secures herself against a counter and waits for us, her arm extended, ready to pull us in once we're within reach. We're still on the ceiling, but only about three meters away horizontally.</p>

<p>Then, the two tables closest to the kitchen fall to the ceiling right in front of us. They roll over a few times and then slam back down the floor. Miles is caught in the gravity sink and tumbles after the tables. A moment later I feel my feet lift off the ground-ceiling, and then I'm sucked down to the floor along with a cluster of the surrounding tables, but I manage to twist and land on my feet, falling to my knees. Sandra does the same.</p>

<p>The chaos of the crashing tables suddenly stops. One of the tables is wedged against the door the captain was waiting in, which is now closed. From behind, it sounds like the captain is trying to kick the door back open. Miles is just a couple of meters away from the door lying on his side. He attempts to stand up but slips, landing flat on his back. He tries again, and then his head and limbs slam back against the floor.</p>

<p>"Miles!" I call out.</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>One of the tables next to Miles starts crumbling, the metal legs bending inwards towards the body.</p>

<p>"Come on, we have to grab Miles," I say. I crouch towards him, keeping my arm outstretched in front of me. When I'm a meter and a half from him, my hand starts feeling very heavy. When I'm a meter away, my hand slams to the ground, sending me flat on my stomach.</p>

<p>"Sandra!" I say urgently, "I can grab him, but you'll have to pull me back out."</p>

<p>I look back at her, and she just stares, no emotion whatsoever.</p>

<p>One of the legs of the table next to Miles tears under the immense pressure, and the exigency of the situation pushes all other concerns from my mind.</p>

<p>"Doc, please!" I say. "We don't have much time. He's going to be crushed." But Sandra ignores me. She just stares down at the pinned man.</p>

<p>"No," comes a calm voice. The voice belongs to Sandra, but the words belong to someone else. "You were right," she says in the same eerily calm voice. "He left Cato to die. I saw it in his eyes. He didn't even have the guts to tell us what really happened." I see her gloved hands clenching into fists. "No. I won't help him."</p>

<p>This isn't like Sandra. The way she looks down at the helpless soldier... she doesn't look like the same woman. I feel desperation creeping into my chest and through my limbs like a cold chill.</p>

<p>"This isn't like you!" I blurt out, "What if that was me? What would you do if I was the one lying there?" No answer comes.</p>

<p>I know Sandra. She was a battlefield nurse. She helped both friendly and enemy soldiers. Any life is worth saving. Those were her own words. Over the course of this voyage, she has been like a big sister to me. She would never leave me to die.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I decide to take a gamble. I raise myself to my hands and knees, and trying my best to prepare myself for what is to come, I put one hand forward and crawl towards Miles. My hand feels like someone is standing on it. I slide my other hand forward. Already I am sweating from the effort. My arms feel like they're made of lead, and my muscles barely have the strength to move them. Again I slide my hand forward and my head bows, my neck unable to support the weight of my skull. Again, I slide forward. My arms start to tremble under the weight, and I lock my elbows to reduce the strain on my muscles. I slide just a few more centimeters forward. The entire upper half of my body is now in the super-gravity well, and I feel an uncomfortable tugging in my torso. I should be close enough to reach Miles now if I stretch out my arm, but I can't lift my head to check.</p>

<p>I snake my right hand forward along the floor, feeling for Miles' arm. Then my arms and legs give out beneath me and I slam flat against my stomach to the floor. The wind is knocked out of me again. I drag my head against the floor and look ahead of me. Miles is just five centimeters out of my reach. Summoning the strength to drag myself forward, I take a deep breath, or rather, I try to take a deep breath. My chest is almost fully compressed and I can barely inhale even a mouthful of air. My chest starts convulsing, trying to bring in oxygen</p>

<p>Knowing that I only have a few seconds left before I pass out, I pull my legs forward and then push against the floor, army crawling towards the lieutenant. I slide my arms forward. My fingertips reach Miles' arm, but I can't grip it. I push myself forward just a little bit more. At the same time, I let my head slide and look back. I grip Miles' arm with both hands. An odd, yet unbearable kind of pain spreads through my chest. My head starts throbbing and my vision blurs and refocuses with the pounding of my heart. My brain feels like it's shutting down.</p>

<p>Then I realize that Sandra is no longer behind me. All I see is an empty space with chairs, dishes and a long table floating lazily in the distance. My vision starts to tunnel. She left. She actually left me&hellip;to die.</p>

<p>My vision has nearly blacked out completely when I feel something grab my ankles and pull. I put all of my concentration into holding onto Miles' arm. I'm dragged across the floor. I don't know how long it takes. I just know that I have to keep holding on to&hellip;whatever it is I'm holding on to&hellip;</p>

<p>Something hits me in the chest and I gasp. Air! Oxygen! But wait, I'm not holding onto anything anymore. I open my eyes and look for Miles. He's on the floor next to me. The captain moves away from me to kneel next to him. She puts his arm around her shoulder and lifts him off the ground. Sandra is nowhere to be seen. A meter behind us a set of chairs crashes and crumples in a metal heap.</p>

<p>I stand up and put Miles' other arm around my shoulder and help the captain lift him. We get to our feet and she guides us around fallen tables to a second door off to the side of the kitchen. Something heavy crashes above and behind us, and we shuffle along as fast as possible and dive through the door.</p>

<h2>The First Uprising</h2>

<p>Well it finally happened. I've been saying for months that this was going to happen and, lo and behold, I was right.</p>

<p>The group which has been calling itself the Equalists held another protest this evening. This time I believe focusing on the birth selection process. Tonight was the boldest they've ever been, and they marched from the market towards the upper level apartments. Of course most of the council members live in the upper levels, we all were a bit apprehensive about our security. So the military stepped in and blocked the way of the protesters.</p>

<p>The leader of the movement, Mr. Perry, of course took this as yet another sign of unequal treatment. He said that the military never once stepped in to protect the lower level apartments or the marketplace. Why were they so fastidious about guarding the upper levels? Since most of the <span style='background-color: #d88'>participents</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>participants</span> of the protest live in the lower levels and probably wouldn't harm their own homes, his logic leaves something to be desired, but he nonetheless was thoroughly convincing to his followers.</p>

<p>We have security tapes, and we saw that it was a group of the protesters who attacked first. It wasn't long afterwards that the military began shooting into the crowd. Twelve people were killed and twenty-seven injured.</p>

<p>Twelve people. Never in the 150 year history of this ship have that many people died in one day. Captain Hsu is threatening to declare martial law, and I think several of my fellow council-members are inclined to let him. We are at a dangerous crossroads. This is sure to only agitate many of the lower levels. Their anger could boil over into more violence, and the result may literally tear the ship apart.</p>

<p>But many are also in mourning, and I think I may be able to use that to calm the people down. It'll be a tricky maneuver. I'll have to both admonish the people of the lower levels to stop the violence or more of their children are going to die, and I'll need to call the leadership to take seriously these grievances and to have compassion on their fellow shipmates. There will of course be many hotheads who don't want to listen, Perry being the primary one I am concerned with.</p>

<p>I think it's time I give Ross a call.</p>

<h2>The <span style='background-color: #d88'>Assasination</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>Assassination</span> Plot</h2>

<p>Commander Stevens asked to meet with me in private this evening, and what he had to say I found greatly disturbing. He informed me that the Captain is planning to <span style='background-color: #d88'>assasinate</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>assassinate</span> Perry. It will of course be made to look like an accident, but the Captain intends to remove Perry from the picture.</p>

<p>The <span style='background-color: #d88'>captian</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>captain</span> thinks that if Perry is no longer there to incite the lower levels, then the Equalists as an organization will fall apart.</p>

<p>Besides the obvious moral problems with this plan, I believe that it will backfire spectacularly. The Captain I think underestimates the people of the lower levels. Many of them will find his death too convenient for the "upper crust" as they are calling us, and I don't think they would put it past us to execute a man by an apparent accident.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, the Captain does have a point. Perry is just going to continue making things worse. But making him a martyr isn't going to help matters. Rather, we need to somehow convince him to tone down his protests or recant. I cannot yet tell if he is genuine or not. He may just enjoy having followers. If the latter, then he can probably be bought out some way.</p>

<p>Or...</p>

<p>What if we got Ross to confront him? Everyone on the ship knows Ross and everyone on the lower levels, including Perry, respects him. If Ross were to denounce Perry's actions and tell him to <span style='background-color: #d88'>disist</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>desist</span> his violent protests, it could effectively hamstring his movement.</p>

<p>And Ross is a pacifist, so I think he would do it.</p>

<p>Now I need to convince the Captain to halt his plan. If Perry dies, the <span style='background-color: #d88'>situaion</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>situation</span> may become irrecoverable.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Captain of course said nothing to incriminate himself of this plan, but through his doublespeak, I understood that I have 24 hours to <span style='background-color: #d88'>disipate</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>dissipate</span> the situation before the he takes matters into his own hands. I also got the feeling that he was surprised I knew about his plan. I am afraid that I've put First Officer Stevens in a precarious situation, but this is I'm afraid a dire situation and I just don't have the time to play politics with everyone.</p>

<h2>Meeting with Ross</h2>

<p>Save for when I have to wait for my wife to finish doing her hair, having a conversation with Ross is the most frustrating experience I have ever had. The man clearly thinks I'm an imbecile. Worse than that even. The man told me that I have "character flaws". Screw him.</p>

<p>However, he agreed to denounce Perry's violent protests and to encourage the protesters speak out peacefully.</p>

<p>Still, that man. He just thinks he is so much better than me.</p>

<h2>Increased Militarization</h2>

<p>Captain Hsu publicly requested that the council approve his proposal to triple (yes triple) his security force. He stated that in order to put an end to these protests, he must make a show of overwhelming strength. To fail to do so would invite disaster and would only ask for more deaths. He even said to us publicly that if we do not approve his proposal, then any further casualties that result from these protests would be on our, the council's, heads.</p>

<p>I of course made the argument that we are not going to go to war within our own ship. This situation must be solved diplomatically. I managed to convince the rest of the council to agree with me. And though I did not make this observation aloud, I did notice that Hsu's proposal would bring a large number of our young people under his wing, as well as arm many of the existing ship's crew. It's a battle of influence. Anyone in the military Hsu has direct control their training. It is a great worry to me that many of our young people in the military are more loyal to him than to the passengers aboard the ship whom they are supposed to protect. It is not lost on me that this may be part of Hsu's longer plan to stage a coup and enact martial law, with himself as benign dictator.</p>

<p>That being the case, I must meet his challenge head on.</p>

<h2>The Second Protest</h2>

<p>This was the worst possible outcome. The worst one. Perry proceeded with his protest in the upper district. Only this time, a group of them brought weapons. Not guns, but farming equipment, baseball bats, and kitchen knives. Five upper district residents were killed. The security force was initially overwhelmed. After a few minutes, the entire security force converged on the upper district. Ten of the protesters were killed, <span style='background-color: #d88'>thrity</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>thirty</span> were seriously injured, and fifteen members of the security force suffered injuries.</p>

<p>Captain Hsu publicly blamed the council for this atrocity. He said that we clearly had not learned our lesson from the first protest, and because, there were even more fatalities. He said that so long as the police force remains restrained, things will only get worse. In order to prevent the ship from falling into complete disarray, we must show strength.</p>

<p>He had us cornered. The entire upper district is seems has been persuaded by Hsu, as well as a large portion of the lower district. We were forced to approve his proposal. He won this round.</p>

<h2>The Memorial Service</h2>

<p>There has been a new development. Today we held a memorial service for all of the victims of the past two protests. All told, twenty-five people died in these protests. I gave a speech, stating that there are no sides in this conflict. The ship has suffered a great loss because of this conflict. We must recognize that we all strive towards the same goal. We are all on the same side. Let us empathize with our fellow shipmates. We are setting the precedents for the future civilization we create. Imagine the kind of society we want our children to live in. Do we want our children to go to war with each other? If not, then let us show them by example how to resolve conflict peacefully. We may not live in perfect harmony. We are human after all. But, we can live peacefully, and we can continue to develop into a better society. Let our children build upon the framework that we set for them.</p>

<p>Then Captain Hsu gave his speech. It makes my stomach turn to think that we had to allow him to speak to the people at such a difficult time. Poison. His words pure poison. He is sowing discord among us so that he can make a power play. But of course no one is smart enough to realize that until it will be too late. Essentially he started off by <span style='background-color: #d88'>apoligizing</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>apologizing</span> to the ship that he wasn't able to to protect us as he should. He said he should have pushed harder for increased security when he knew it was required (another slight at the council). He called us a family, and that anyone who threatens his family will face the consequences. Justice will be swift and it will be without mercy.</p>

<p>And after that, Ross gave a speech. He started off very simply, giving his condolences and saying something about broken hearts. And then his tone shifted. I am recording it here as best as I can remember.</p>

<p>"People of the Waiting Dragon, I have some disturbing news for you, and a warning. There are members of this crew who will use violence to achieve their own selfish ambitions. There are some who have lost track of the charter of this ship. This ship was sent out among the stars to find a new home and to create a new society, one better than the one we left, where instead of violence, greed, and selfish ambition, we have peace, collaboration, and charity. I beg you all to remember that, and to strive for this goal set up by our forebears.</p>

<p>"The protests that we have witnessed are not without cause. There is inequality aboard this ship and anyone who <span style='background-color: #d88'>denys</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>denies</span> this is purposefully being ignorant. It is the duty of those suffering oppression to bring their grievances forward peacefully and to seek change, and it is the duty of those with power to listen and to promote that change.</p>

<p>"But there are some who have taken advantage of the situation. Like some grand chess game, they see opportunity to advance their own position, and they are will to sacrifice the lives of people aboard this ship to achieve their goals. The deaths we have seen from these protests were planned. They were executed to incite fear among you, to get you so sacrifice your freedom, for the hope of security. There were planned so that one man could gain unilateral power over this ship. The man behind these attacks is none other than Captain Hsu."</p>

<p>This obviously caused a huge commotion. Ross was arrested and the security forces moved in to disperse the crowd. Everyone was sent home. Not long afterwards, the police <span style='background-color: #d88'>commisioner</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>commissioner</span> gave a ship wide announcement saying that Ross is in league with the protesters and is only trying to stir up <span style='background-color: #d88'>dissention</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>dissension</span> and chaos aboard the ship. The commissioner said that we must be discerning and to ignore any lies that would seek to break the unity of this ship.</p>

<p>Captain Hsu has placed the ship on lockdown until the following morning.</p>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p>Everything has changed. We always assumed that if there were planets that could support life out there, then they would most likely be supporting life. But that was always an abstract concept, it never felt real. It doesn't feel real now.</p>

<p>Captain Hsu called an emergency meeting for the council. Given recent events, I had assumed this was another <span style='background-color: #d88'>stategic</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>strategic</span> move in his plot to take over the ship. I had been up to that point preparing for a number of scenarios that would require skillful statesmanship in order to thwart him. Unfortunately what he said threw all that preparation straight out the airlock, as it were.</p>

<p>"Approximately...fourty-seven minutes ago, the Waiting Dragon was forced to a relative stop by some unknown force. It was done using some kind of <span style='background-color: #d88'>intertial</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>inertial</span> dampening field so strong that the only reason we noticed is that our astronavigation system reported that the stars weren't moving like they should. That and the ship parked directly in front of us."</p>

<p>Obviously the mention of another ship cause a stir among the council, and that's an understatement if ever there was one. When our forebears set out, they did so with the assumption that they and their descendants would never see another ship or another human society again, at least not until we were able to control wormholes. </p>

<p>"The ship, so far as we can tell, is not human. The technology and design are unlike anything we've ever seen. I've asked our senior engineers to examine our scans of the ship, and they for the most part have no idea how it works."</p>

<p>"Have they tried to communicate with us?" I asked. "Or have we attempted to communicate with them?"</p>

<p>"No," the captain said. "It is also my conclusion that they are responsible to stopping our ship. And we are still unable to move. This alien ship has trapped us, which I am forced to take as a sign of <span style='background-color: #d88'>agression.</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>aggression.</span> As such, I am declaring a state of emergency."</p>

<p>"The hell you are," I said. "This is a historic moment for humanity. The moon landing doesn't even come close to the import of this situation. First contact with a an alien race is not something to be handled with military force. This is a situation that calls for diplomacy, and the people of this ship need to be represented by those elected to represent them."</p>

<p>The captain smiled at this, or more like sneered. "The last time you tried diplomacy, fifteen people died. Or perhaps you've already forgotten that incident--"</p>

<p>"This situation is entirely different!" I retorted. "We aren't dealing with angry protesters. This is first contact!"</p>

<p>"You are correct," the captain said. "This situation is different. The stakes are much higher. We do not know the intentions of these aliens. If they find us weak, they may ransack us, enslave us, or if we happen to be encroaching on their territory, they may choose to just destroy us." </p>

<p>I started to respond but the captain held up his hand and continued. "And before you tell me about the precedent we are setting and how we want leave our children with a peaceful society, I ask you, what good will your precedent do for our children if we're all dead?"</p>

<p>"And so," the captain continued, "I put it before you. I am declaring a state of emergency. Approve or disprove now."</p>

<p>I turned to the rest of the council. "I implore you, do not let this man usurp control of this ship, not at such a critical time as this. This is what the people of this ship elected us for. The represent them and to decide how to handle situations as these. They did not elect him," I said, pointing at the captain. "If this man takes control, then mark my words, the result of this first contact will be a new enemy, and one whose power and capabilities we know nothing about. I implore you, to do the right thing."</p>

<p>The council voted, five to four, against the <span style='background-color: #d88'>decleration.</span><span style='background-color: #8d8'>declaration.</span></p>

<p>"Let the record show," I said, "the declaration of emergency powers has been revoked."</p>
